## <b>"Explain to me about"</b>

I developed this app as a way to test out the Google AI API (Gemini API).

You can ask the app to explain you a concept in the desired amount of minutes (from 1 to 15 minutes).

Please, feel free to ask me any question about it.

The next step I want to do is to stream the response, ala the known AI chatbots.

To run the project:

/frontend$ npm run dev
/backend$ python -m flask run
